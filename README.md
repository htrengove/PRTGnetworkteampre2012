# PRTGnetworkteampre2012
#Is used to monitor Network Teams on Servers before 2012, particularly Broadcoms Teams
Sensor needs to be setup as a Custom Advanced EXE/XML sensor, after coping the script to the custom sensors directory
2 Parameters need to be feed when creating the sensor in the format "computername" "Network Adaptor name",
for example if you are using Broadcom adaptors it would look like "server01" "*Broadcom*" it accepts wildcards and full names
# from here the sensor will start to monitor accordingly.
